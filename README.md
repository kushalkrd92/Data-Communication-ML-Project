# Data-Communication-ML-Project

In this project, I have explored how linear regression helps predict sales based on TV advertising expenses. I start by loading the dataset and visualizing the data with scatter plots to see if there’s a pattern. Then, I calculated the regression line using mathematical formulas to find the slope (w1) and intercept (w0). This line helps estimate sales based on TV spending. I also measure the accuracy of my predictions by calculating the mean absolute error, which shows how far my predicted sales are from the actual values.

I have used Scikit-learn’s LinearRegression model. I split the data into training and testing sets so the model can learn from past data and predict future sales more accurately. By using this machine learning approach, I can compare the manually calculated regression line with the one generated by Scikit-learn. To measure the accuracy of my predictions, I have calculated the mean absolute error (MAE), which tells me the average difference between the actual sales and my predicted values. A lower error means the model is making better predictions. However, manual calculations can be time-consuming and prone to mistakes, so I implement the same regression using Scikit-learn’s LinearRegression model. This automated approach not only speeds up the process but also improves prediction accuracy by optimizing model parameters using training data.
